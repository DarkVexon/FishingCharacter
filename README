The Adventurer

The Adventurer is a new character with a variety of different abilities - notably Fish and Foil cards.

Keywords
-Fish: 0 cost Colorless cards with bonus effects that draw a card when played. Created by certain cards and abilities.
-Voyaged: A bonus effect that triggers if you drew the card this turn outside of your opening hand.
-Solo: A bonus effect that triggers if the card is the only one in your hand.
-Quest: When you complete a Quest, gain its Reward. If you already have that Quest, you draw a card instead of starting it.
-Foil: Roughly 1/3 of card rewards while playing as the Adventurer will contain a shiny Foil card! They do nothing by themselves, but some cards interact with them.

Thanks for playing! I hope you have fun.
